# 002 - Use Click and Rich for CLI

## Context

We need to create a command-line interface (CLI) for the script. There are several libraries available for creating CLIs in Python.

## Decision

We will use Click for argument parsing and command structure, and Rich for enhancing terminal output.

## Consequences

-   Click provides a simple and intuitive way to create command-line interfaces.
-   Rich provides a way to add formatting, colors, and other enhancements to terminal output.
-   These libraries are relatively easy to learn and use.
-   They have good documentation and a large community.
